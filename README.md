Misc. stuff, usually small scripts and little tools

 - **Scripts/oracle-maf-adf-mobile-icon-splashscreen-generator.sh** - small script to auto generate the myriad of icons and splash screens for iOS and Android apps you need with Oracle Mobile Application Framework (MAF) (formerly ADF Mobile). Good for when creating quick demo apps.
 - **RSS Ingest** (https://code.google.com/p/rssingest/ - hosted by Google Code) - a primitive single PHP script written years ago to fetch RSS feeds and save results to database. Downloaded thousands of times and I still get the occasional email regarding usage, thanks or extensions.
 - **Scripts/list-compare.php** - This little tool solves a real problem of being able to loosely compare and find matches between 2 seperate lists of people names, customer names, lines or words. While modern text editors can compare files for literal technical matching lines they are not good at "rough"/fuzzy matches. This tool does that! Also available for free online use at http://www.nexle.dk/tools/list-compare/ (just upload some text and try it out!)
 - **Scripts/findTopUniques.java** - A dirty but working little Java program to fetch the first N rows per unique KEY from a textual files, where KEY is an arbitrary column in the file (i.e. CSV file) with an arbitrary delimeter.
