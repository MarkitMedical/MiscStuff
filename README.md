Misc. stuff, usually small scripts and little tools

 - **Scripts/oracle-maf-adf-mobile-icon-splashscreen-generator.sh** - small script to auto generate the myriad of icons and splash screens for iOS and Android apps you need with Oracle Mobile Application Framework (MAF) (formerly ADF Mobile). Good for when creating quick demo apps.
 - **RSS Ingest** (https://code.google.com/p/rssingest/ - hosted by Google Code) - a primitive single PHP script written years ago to fetch RSS feeds and save results to database. Downloaded thousands of times and I still get the occasional email regarding usage, thanks or extensions.
